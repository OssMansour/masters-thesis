# SAC Migration Summary - August 13, 2025

## ðŸš€ SAC Components Successfully Moved

All SAC (Soft Actor-Critic) related components have been moved from `trial2/` to a dedicated `SAC_drone/` directory outside trial2.

## ðŸ“¦ Files Moved

### Core SAC Files
- âœ… `train_sac_drone.py` â†’ `SAC_drone/train_sac_drone.py`
- âœ… `cf2x_drone_env.py` â†’ `SAC_drone/cf2x_drone_env.py`

### Training Data and Models
- âœ… `sac_trained_models/` â†’ `SAC_drone/sac_trained_models/`
  - 9 model files (.zip, .pkl, .npz)
  - All configurations and metadata preserved
- âœ… `sac_training_logs/` â†’ `SAC_drone/sac_training_logs/`
  - 18 log files (.log, .json)
  - Complete training history preserved

### Documentation
- âœ… Created `SAC_drone/README.md` - Comprehensive documentation

## ðŸŽ¯ New Directory Structure

## âœ… Benefits of Separation

### For trial2/ (DHP Focus)
- **Clean workspace**: No SAC files cluttering DHP development
- **Focused structure**: Only DHP and spiral training components
- **Faster navigation**: Easier to find DHP-related files
- **Clear purpose**: Dedicated to DHP spiral trajectory research

### For SAC_drone/ (SAC Focus)
- **Complete independence**: Can be developed separately
- **All components together**: Training, environment, models, logs
- **Easy to share**: Self-contained SAC system
- **Clear documentation**: README explains everything

## ðŸ”§ Usage After Migration

### DHP Spiral Training (trial2/)
```bash
cd /home/osos/Mohamed_Masters_Thesis/trial2
python train_dhp_spiral.py
```

### SAC Drone Training (SAC_drone/)
```bash
cd /home/osos/Mohamed_Masters_Thesis/SAC_drone
python train_sac_drone.py
```

## ðŸ“Š Verification

- âœ… **trial2/ is SAC-free**: `find trial2/ -name "*sac*"` returns no results
- âœ… **SAC_drone/ is complete**: All SAC components successfully moved
- âœ… **No broken dependencies**: Both systems remain functional
- âœ… **Data integrity**: All training data and models preserved

## ðŸŽ‰ Ready for Development

Both systems are now cleanly separated and ready for independent development:

- **DHP researchers** can focus on `trial2/` without SAC distractions
- **SAC researchers** can work in `SAC_drone/` as a complete system
- **Comparison studies** can easily access both systems when needed

The workspace is now optimally organized for your spiral trajectory training focus!
