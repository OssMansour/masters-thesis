- Benefits from explicit reference signals

**SAC Requirements:**
- Needs comprehensive state information
- Requires X,Y position feedback for spatial control
- Works better with full kinematic state (20 states)

This insight demonstrates deep understanding of the fundamental architectural differences between algorithms.

### **Phase 3: Comparative Analysis** ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê **READY TO EXECUTE**

#### **Framework Prepared:**
- ‚úÖ Identical environments for fair comparison
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive metrics collection system
