## 3. Control Systems Architecture

### 3.1 Control Hierarchy

The framework implements a layered control approach:

**High-Level Planning** → **PID Control** → **Motor Commands** → **Physics Simulation**

### 3.2 BaseControl Interface

**Abstract Design:**
- Standardized `computeControl()` interface
- URDF parameter parsing for physical constants
- PID coefficient management system
- State vector compatibility with environment observations

**Key Methods:**
- `computeControl()`: Abstract method for control computation
- `computeControlFromState()`: Interface using observation state
- `setPIDCoefficients()`: Dynamic PID tuning
- `_getURDFParameter()`: Physical parameter extraction

### 3.3 DSL PID Controller (`DSLPIDControl`)

**Implementation Details:**
- Specialized for Crazyflie platforms (CF2X, CF2P)
- Position and attitude control loops
- **Position PID Gains**: 
  - P=[0.4, 0.4, 1.25]
  - I=[0.05, 0.05, 0.05]
  - D=[0.2, 0.2, 0.5]
- **Attitude PID Gains**: 
  - P=[70000, 70000, 60000]
  - I=[0, 0, 500]
  - D=[20000, 20000, 12000]

**Mixer Matrices:**
- **CF2X (X-configuration)**: 4x3 matrix for X-quadrotor with cross-coupling
  ```python
  [-.5, -.5, -1],  # Each motor affects both pitch and roll
  [-.5,  .5,  1],
  [ .5,  .5, -1],
  [ .5, -.5,  1]
  ```
- **CF2P (Plus-configuration)**: 4x3 matrix with natural decoupling
  ```python
  [ 0, -1, -1],    # Front motor: pure pitch control
  [ 1,  0,  1],    # Right motor: pure roll control  
  [ 0,  1, -1],    # Rear motor: pure pitch control
  [-1,  0,  1]     # Left motor: pure roll control
  ```

**DHP Advantage with CF2P:**
The CF2P configuration provides natural longitudinal/lateral decoupling that perfectly aligns with DHP's split actor architecture. This eliminates cross-coupling effects and simplifies the control problem for neural network learning.

**Control Pipeline:**
1. Position control computes desired thrust and attitude
2. Attitude control generates motor commands via mixer matrix
3. PWM-to-RPM conversion with clipping (MIN_PWM=20000, MAX_PWM=65535)
